# Profile
profile: |
  Hello, I am a 2nd year M.S./Ph.D. student in Computer Architecture and
  Systems Lab (SNU-CompArch) at Seoul National University. I am working on the
  topics in <em>efficient systems for emerging applications like Generative
  AI</em> under the supervision of Prof. <a
  href="https://jaewoong.org">Jaewoong Sim</a>. My research interests are also
  in Hardware-Software Co-design and Memory Systems. I received my B.S. degree
  from Seoul National University (2022).

    details: I implemented a cycle-level CXL interconnection simulator that can
      be easily integrated with the existing DRAM simulators. I analyze the
      timing behavior of the CXL-interconnection using the simulator for
      different DRAM configurations and memory-intensive SPEC CPU 2006
      benchmarks.
