#   Hello, I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student in Computer Architecture and
#   Systems Lab (SNU-CompArch) at Seoul National University. I am working on the
#   topics in <em>efficient systems for emerging applications like Generative
#   AI</em> under the supervision of Prof. <a
#   href="https://jaewoong.org" style="color:#585DAC">Jaewoong Sim</a>. My research interests are also
#   in Hardware-Software Co-design and Memory Systems. I received my B.S. degree
#   from Seoul National University (2022).
